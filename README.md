Short info: SPA (Single-page application) that updates data in real time and is very easy to use. All it takes is to make a plan with password (no confirmation via email). Just share the plan name and password with your companions and you can start filling out the list of things you need for the trip at the same time. There is a list for ‘finished’ and ‘unfinished’ things as well as a 'complete' list. The advantage is that when your companions check that they have prepared something for the trip or if they have added something to the list, you will immediately receive this information.
